# Data--Science-Project-ENSO--Analysis
Analysis and exploration of the ENSO dataset and create a predictive model for ENSO anomaly values.
The goal of this project is to use machine-learning techniques (train an xgboost regression model) to predict the values of the measurements of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) for the following few months. These indexes are strongly associated with El ni√±o phenomenon.
GGiven the nature of the datum, I decided to make time series forecasting using machine learning tools, namely the xgboost regression python tool. So, we transform the time series forecasting into a regression problem.
